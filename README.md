company sales app

An application created to control the sales of each seller in the company. Sellers will login with their registration and login, and when making a new sale, will add the sale details.
With this in mind, it is possible to: check the total sales of the company, the company's revenue; view the sales history of another seller (from a logged-in user/seller); view their own revenue.
The app has standard functionalities (back button, functional buttons, change profile picture).
